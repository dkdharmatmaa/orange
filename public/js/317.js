These\r\n        scans help you understand the effects of your workouts.\r\n        o When You Express Interest in Purchasing an Orangetheory Franchise. If\r\n        you express interest in owning an Orangetheory franchise, we will collect your\r\n        name, physical address, email address, phone number, information about your\r\n        finances, information about the location in which you are interested in starting\r\n        your franchise, and any other information you provide to us with your\r\n        submission.\r\n        o Information We Collect from Franchisees. As described above, if you visit an\r\n        Orangetheory Fitness studio owned by one of our franchisees, you will be\r\n        providing your information directly to the franchisee.

Information from\r\n        your OTbeat heart rate monitor, however, is not shared among franchisees. For\r\n        further information on how our franchisees process your information for their\r\n        own purposes, please contact your studio.\r\n\r\n        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023\r\n\r\n        o Information We Collect from Social Networking Sites. You may log into your\r\n        online account or our Apps through Facebook.

OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS\r\n        We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track\r\n        information about your use of our Site and App. Where permitted under applicable law, we\r\n        may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our\r\n        service providers may do so on our behalf).\r\n        Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard\r\n        drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to\r\n        make it easier for you to navigate our Site and App, while others are used to enable a\r\n        faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and App.\r\n        Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer,\r\n        you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the\r\n        toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new\r\n        cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to\r\n        disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse\r\n        certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.\r\n        Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a\r\n        unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on\r\n        your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web or mobile\r\n        application pages. We may use clear GIFs (aka web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in\r\n        connection with our Site and App to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors\r\n        and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site\r\n        and Apps. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our\r\n        customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and\r\n        track whether our emails are forwarded.\r\n        Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Adobe Analytics and\r\n        Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site, and to the extent permitted, our Apps. We\r\n        also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site and Apps. We use these tools to\r\n        help us improve our Site’s and Apps’ performance and user experiences. These entities\r\n        may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage\r\n        objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To opt-out of Adobe Analytics, please\r\n        visit https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html.

This enables us and network\r\n        advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be\r\n        interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement\r\n        services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs,\r\n        and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to\r\n        personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are\r\n        governed by each entity’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these\r\n        advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.\r\n        We may disclose certain information (such as your email address) to Facebook Custom\r\n        Audiences (for more information on Facebook Custom Audience go here or to opt-out, go\r\n        to the Facebook ad preferences page)—so that we can better target ads and content to\r\n        you and others with similar interests on other websites or media (“Custom Audiences”). We\r\n        may also work with other ad networks and marketing platforms that enable us and other\r\n        participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and others. You may also\r\n        control how Facebook and other ad networks display certain ads to you, as explained\r\n        further in their respective privacy policies or by using the opt-outs described below.\r\n        Users in the United States may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to\r\n        the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about\r\n        opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information\r\n        used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)\r\n        Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and\r\n        their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. If you are in the EU, you\r\n        may opt out of certain ad network cookies that we and other websites may use for targeted\r\n        advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)   Your\r\n        Online Choices Page or www.aboutads.info. Users in Australia may opt out of certain ad\r\n        networks by going to the Your Online Choices Page for information about opting-out of\r\n        interest-based advertising and choices available from participating organizations. Users in\r\n        Canada should go to the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada (“DAAC”) AdChoices Page for\r\n        information about opting out of interest-based advertising and the choices available from\r\n        DAAC members.\r\n\r\n        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023\r\n\r\n        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page,  the\r\n        NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or a country- or region-specific consumer choice website will\r\n        opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it\r\n        does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other\r\n        websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the\r\n        particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers\r\n        are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on a consumer choice website, your opt\r\n        out may not be effective.\r\n        5. LINKS\r\n        Our Site and Apps may contain links to unaffiliated entities’ websites.

We are not responsible for the information practices of\r\n        such websites.\r\n        6.

We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised\r\n        passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.\r\n        7.

We will process opt-out requests in accordance with applicable law. If you\r\n        opt-out of receiving promotional communications about recommendations or other\r\n        information we think may interest you, we may still send you communications about your\r\n        account or any services you have requested or received from us. App users may enable or\r\n        disable push notifications by adjusting their App or device settings.\r\n        Our franchisees also send their own marketing communications in accordance with\r\n        applicable law. If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from our\r\n        franchisees, you will need to separately opt-out of the respective franchisee’s marketing\r\n        communications. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the promotional\r\n        communications sent by our franchisees.\r\n        9.
