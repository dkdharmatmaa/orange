            Orangetheory is a 1-hour, full body workout, focused on training Endurance,
            Strength, and Power. We use Heart Rate Based Interval Training, which burns more calories
            post workout than traditional exercise. When wearing our Heart Rate monitors, your real
            time results are displayed on large screens throughout the studio. Intensity is based on your
            individual Heart Rate zones, making the workout effective for all fitness levels. To top it off,
            our fitness coaches lead the workout to prevent you from over or under training.

        Privacy Policy
        EFFECTIVE DATE: January 27, 2021
        Ultimate Fitness Group, LLC d/b/a Orangetheory® Fitness (“Ultimate,” “we,”
        “us,” or “our”) values your privacy. In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we
        describe how we collect, use, and disclose information we obtain about
        visitors to our website, www.orangetheoryfitness.com  (the “Site”), users of
        our mobile applications (the “App” or “Apps”), visitors to Orangetheory®
        Fitness studios (whether owned by Ultimate or one of our franchisees), and
        the services available through our Site and App, and how we use and
        disclose that information.
        This Policy does not apply to a franchisee’s collection, use, and disclosure of
        your information, except as described in this policy with regard to data
        sharing and change of a franchisee.
        By visiting the Site, using, or downloading the App, or using any of our
        services, you acknowledge that your personal information will be handled as
        described in this Policy. Where required under applicable law, we will obtain
        your consent to collect, use, transfer, or disclose your personal information.
        Your use of our Site, App, or services, and any dispute over privacy, is
        subject to this Policy and our Terms of Use, including its applicable
        limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. The Terms of Use are
        incorporated by reference into this Policy.

        1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
        We collect information (including sensitive personal information, as defined under

        through your use of our Site and App, and where required by applicable law, with your
        consent. This information is collected, used, and disclosed by us for the purposes
        described in further detail in Sections 2 and 3 of this Privacy Policy.
        Information We Collect Directly from You. The information we collect from you depends
        on how you use our Site, App, and Services.

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        o To Sign Up for a Trial Workout Online. To sign up for a trial workout at an
        Orangetheory® Fitness studio through our Site or App, you must provide us with
        your name, email address, phone number, date of birth, your payment
        information (in order to hold your trial workout reservation), and the studio you
        would like to attend for your workout. We also will collect information that you
        provide about any health conditions that could affect your ability to participate in
        a workout. If you do not provide this information, you will not be able to sign up
        for or participate in a trial workout.
        o To Schedule or Purchase Sessions Online. To create an account to sign up
        for workout sessions or to purchase sessions online through our Site or our App,
        you must provide us with your name, physical address, email address, date of
        birth, phone number, height and weight, payment and billing information, and
         username and password. If you complete a membership agreement or sign up
        for a fitness event, we also collect information that you provide about any health
        conditions that could affect your ability to participate in a workout. If you do not
        provide this information, you will not be able to create an online account,
        complete a membership agreement, or make a purchase.
        We will also collect information about the workouts you schedule and
        information about your purchases, such as the class packages you purchase.
        You may also provide information about your preferences, such as your favorite
        studios and coaches.
        o When You Visit an Orangetheory Fitness Studio. If you sign up for a trial
        workout or become an Orangetheory member by registering at an
        Orangetheory® Fitness studio (whether owned by Ultimate or one of our
        franchisees), you must provide us or our franchisee (as applicable) with your
        name, physical address, email address, date of birth, phone number, height and
        weight, marital status, emergency contact information, and payment and billing
        information. We or our franchisee (as applicable) also will collect information
        that you provide about any health conditions that could affect your ability to
        participate in a workout. If you do not provide this information, we or our
        franchisee (as applicable) may not be able to offer our services to you.
        We or our franchisee (as applicable) also will collect information about the
        workout sessions you schedule, details about your exercise frequency and goals
        (as provided by you), and information about your in-studio purchases, such as
        the class packages you purchase. We or our franchisee (as applicable) will also

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        collect information when you check in for a workout, such as your name,
        address, email address, member number, and studio location. If you provide
        your information to a studio owned by one of our franchisees, the franchisee will
        share the information you provide to us — please see the Information We
        Collect from Franchisees section below.
        As part of your workout session, you may choose to use our OTbeat heart rate
        monitors. If you do so, we will collect your workout session heart rate, and other
        workout statistics, such as the number of miles run or rowed.
        At certain locations you have the option of voluntarily participating in a body
        scanning program. This scan will measure your body’s muscle mass, fat
        percentage, and total body water, and will report your overall body composition
        and body mass index (based on your height, weight, gender, and age). These
        scans help you understand the effects of your workouts.
        o When You Express Interest in Purchasing an Orangetheory Franchise. If
        you express interest in owning an Orangetheory franchise, we will collect your
        name, physical address, email address, phone number, information about your
        finances, information about the location in which you are interested in starting
        your franchise, and any other information you provide to us with your
        submission.
        o Information We Collect from Franchisees. As described above, if you visit an
        Orangetheory Fitness studio owned by one of our franchisees, you will be
        providing your information directly to the franchisee. When you provide your
        information to a franchisee (including your in-studio sign up information,
        purchases you make at a franchise, and your workout information), the
        franchisee will make this information available to Ultimate. The franchisee,
        however, handles all billing and account administration, including determining
        how your information is used for the franchisee’s own marketing purposes in
        accordance with applicable laws. If you register for a workout at a different
        location from your home studio, then the owners of both studios — the one at
        which you completed your workout and your home studio — will have access to
        information about your workout registration and participation. Information from
        your OTbeat heart rate monitor, however, is not shared among franchisees. For
        further information on how our franchisees process your information for their
        own purposes, please contact your studio.

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
        We may share your information, including personal information, as follows:
        o Workout Sessions and Challenges. During a workout session, participants
        may share their name and OTbeat heart rate information with other session
        participants on our in-studio display screens. If you participate in a workout
        challenge, you may share your name and workout information with other
        challenge participants. You may also share information about your workouts and
        challenges you participate in with your social media accounts.
        o Orangetheory Franchisees. If we collect information from you requesting a trial
        workout in your area, we will provide that information to the local franchisee.
        When you sign up for a workout or schedule or purchase sessions through our
        Site or App or in-person at a studio, such information is hosted by Mindbody Inc.
        (“Mindbody”), a service provider under contract with Ultimate and our
        franchisees. All data hosted by Mindbody is made available to Ultimate and the
        franchise owner of your home studio (if applicable). If you complete a workout at
        a studio different from your home studio, then your data will be available to the
        owners of both studios. If a franchisee sells or otherwise transfers its franchise,
        we will transfer member information controlled by the outgoing franchisee to the
        successor franchisee. If you utilize a body scanner at a franchisee-owned
        studio, we will share your scan results with that franchisee.
        o Health-focused Apps and Websites. With your consent, we may share your
        personal information, including workout and health data, with unaffiliated health-

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        focused mobile applications and websites to help you track your health and
        wellness information. If you choose to share your information with these apps,
        your personal information, including your health information, will be used in
        accordance with those apps’ and websites’ own privacy policies, not this one.
        Before consenting to sharing your personal information with any third party apps
        or websites, you should make sure that you have read, understood, and agree
        to their own privacy policy and terms of use.
        o Affiliates. We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates
        or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personally
        identifiable information will be subject to this Policy.
        o Service Providers. We disclose the information we collect from you to our
        vendors, service providers, contractors, and agents who perform functions on
        our behalf. In particular, the workout sign-up portal is hosted by Mindbody; in
        addition, as noted above, when you register for a workout with a particular
        studio, your information is made available to the owner of that particular location
        and to Ultimate.

        Where required by applicable laws, we will put in place appropriate security measures
        and/or request these third parties have in place security measures to protect your personal
        information.
        We also disclose information in the following circumstances:
        o Business Transfers. If (i) we or our affiliates are or may be acquired by,
        merged with, or invested in by another company, or (ii) if any of our assets are
        or may be transferred to another company, whether as part of a bankruptcy or
        insolvency proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer the information we have
        collected from you to the other company. As part of the business transfer
        process, we will share certain of your personal information with lenders,
        auditors, and advisors, including attorneys and consultants.
        o In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information we
        collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, or other
        legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
        o To Protect Us and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect
        from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
        regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or
        where it is reasonably necessary as evidence in litigation in which Ultimate is
        involved.
        o Aggregate and De-Identified Information. We may share aggregate, de-
        identified, or anonymized information about users and members with others for
        marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.

         4. OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS
        We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track
        information about your use of our Site and App. Where permitted under applicable law, we
        may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our
        service providers may do so on our behalf).
        Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard
        drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to
        make it easier for you to navigate our Site and App, while others are used to enable a
        faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and App.
        Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer,
        you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the
        toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
        cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
        disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse
        certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
        Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a
        unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on
        your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web or mobile
        application pages. We may use clear GIFs (aka web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in
        connection with our Site and App to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors
        and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Site
        and Apps. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our
        customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and
        track whether our emails are forwarded.
        Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Adobe Analytics and
        Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site, and to the extent permitted, our Apps. We
        also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site and Apps. We use these tools to
        help us improve our Site’s and Apps’ performance and user experiences. These entities
        may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage
        objects (LSOs), to perform their services. To opt-out of Adobe Analytics, please
        visit https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html. To learn more about Google’s privacy

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy
        at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can also download the Google Analytics
        Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics
        at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
        Do Not Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.
        You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling
        cookies); you also may opt out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the
        Ad Networks section.
        Ad Networks. We use network advertisers to serve advertisements on unaffiliated
        websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and network
        advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be
        interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement
        services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs,
        and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
        personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are
        governed by each entity’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these
        advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
        We may disclose certain information (such as your email address) to Facebook Custom
        Audiences (for more information on Facebook Custom Audience go here or to opt-out, go
        to the Facebook ad preferences page)—so that we can better target ads and content to
        you and others with similar interests on other websites or media (“Custom Audiences”). We
        may also work with other ad networks and marketing platforms that enable us and other
        participants to target ads to Custom Audiences submitted by us and others. You may also
        control how Facebook and other ad networks display certain ads to you, as explained
        further in their respective privacy policies or by using the opt-outs described below.
        Users in the United States may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to
        the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about
        opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information
        used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)
        Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and
        their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. If you are in the EU, you
        may opt out of certain ad network cookies that we and other websites may use for targeted
        advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)   Your
        Online Choices Page or www.aboutads.info. Users in Australia may opt out of certain ad
        networks by going to the Your Online Choices Page for information about opting-out of
        interest-based advertising and choices available from participating organizations. Users in
        Canada should go to the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada (“DAAC”) AdChoices Page for
        information about opting out of interest-based advertising and the choices available from
        DAAC members.

        Privacy policy version 1.2 – 1 st April 2023

        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page,  the
        NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or a country- or region-specific consumer choice website will
        opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it
        does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other
        websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the
        particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers
        are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on a consumer choice website, your opt
        out may not be effective.
        5. LINKS
        Our Site and Apps may contain links to unaffiliated entities’ websites. Any access to and
        use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the

        and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised
        passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
        7. ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

        8. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING PROMOTIONAL
        COMMUNICATIONS?
        In accordance with applicable law, we will send periodic promotional communications to
        you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions
        contained in the communication, or if you have opted-in to our promotional text messages,
        replying STOP. We will process opt-out requests in accordance with applicable law. If you
        opt-out of receiving promotional communications about recommendations or other
        information we think may interest you, we may still send you communications about your
        account or any services you have requested or received from us. App users may enable or
        disable push notifications by adjusting their App or device settings.
        Our franchisees also send their own marketing communications in accordance with
        applicable law. If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from our
        franchisees, you will need to separately opt-out of the respective franchisee’s marketing
        communications. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the promotional
        communications sent by our franchisees.
